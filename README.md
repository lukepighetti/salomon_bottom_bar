# salomon_bottom_bar

Yet another bottom navigation bar, but with a few key promises.

## Promises

We [guarantee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9l5Ou-WNro) the following:

1. We will meet the specifications provided by Aurélien Salomon and his gorgeous [Google Bottom Bar Navigation Pattern](https://dribbble.com/shots/5925052-Google-Bottom-Bar-Navigation-Pattern/).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukepighetti/salomon_bottom_bar/master/readme/tab-ui-final.gif" height="300">

2. We will be accessible.

3. We will mimic the semantics of [BottomNavigationBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html)

NOTE: Any use cases not covered by Salomon's specification are not guaranteed by this package.

## Contributing

Create an issue / pull-request when we are not keeping our promises, ie:

1. The package does not match the Salomon specification.
2. There is an accessibility problem.
3. It diverges from `BottomNavigationBar` semantics.
